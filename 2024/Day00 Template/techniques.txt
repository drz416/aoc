Day 01
    p1: Using heaps (heapq) to compare lowest numbers in lists
    p1: Using Counter from collections, easily counts one of the lists for comparison
Day 02
    p1: Single loop with early breaks to avoid parsing every element in a report
    p2: Double nested loop with early breaks to avoid parsing every element, and also every variant combination
Day 03
    p1: Use regex's to find all the correctly spelled syntax, then perform calculations on results
    p2: First parse the entire string and pull out only part of string that is after do(), then use above method's regex to get mul commands only
Day 04
    p1: Scan the grid with nested loops x, y, looking for Xs and use a dictionary to index into directions
    p2: Scan the grid with nested loops x, y, looking for As and use a dictionary to index into directions
Day 05
    p1: Use itertools.combinations to cycle through all 2p combinations, and check if they break rules
    p2: For failed updates, use a modified bubble sorting algorithm to order the updates correctly
Day 06
    p1: Traversed a grid using current position as reference (list), and historic positions as dictinary tuples
    p2: Traversed a grid using current position as reference (list), and historic positions as dictinary tuples
Day 07
    p1: Use itertools.product to generate all operator combinations, call operator functions from a dict
    p2: As above but add another operator into the dictionary
Day 08
    p1: Calculate slope betweeb two antennas, project slope ahead and before to find nodes
    p2: As above, but project continuously along slopes until nodes leave the grid area
Day 09
    p1: Mutable array manipulation modeled with a list, using a front of list and back of list seek index
    p2: As above, but also keeping track of block lengths for replacement in blocks
Day 10
    p1: Used recursion to traverse grid, looking for trail-ends, stored trail-ends in set for unique ends
    p2: Same recurision as above, but stored trail-ends in a list were multiple paths are possible
